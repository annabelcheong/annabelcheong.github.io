            <h5>Dec 2014-Nov 2015</h5> <p>Early Concept Development Process Engineer, Chevron 
                <br>Perth - Gorgon Plant</p>

            <p>
                The main function of this role was to determine the feasibility of adding future gas fields in the 
                north west vicinity of Western Australia to feed the Gorgon LNG Plant for brownfield expansion 
                development. This study included the use of the Pipephase software to determine inlet pressures at 
                various flow rates to obtain specific outlet pressures using the provided gas source compositions and 
                conditions to assess the fieldsâ€™ tie-in viability. Simulation work performed on the Gorgon complex 
                HYSYS model using the Peng-Robinson package to converge a process rating case using different specific 
                gas blends from two different fields to determine if the as installed equipment could continue to operate 
                at adjusted conditions to design.
                <br><br>
                Initiated building the Simplified Gorgon Model on HYSYS and completed the Inlet and Stabilization 
                process units. The model enables Facilities Engineering and Operations to quickly identify bottlenecks, 
                generate process stream information and manipulate variables to test output limits. Datasheets, basis of 
                design, control narratives and other relevant Gorgon documents were used to build the Simplified Gorgon 
                Process Model.

                (270,000 tonnes) assisting with design change notifications, Reviewed contractor technical site queries and 
                developed the associated site instructions for contractor implementation. Daily contractor engagement on the 
                fabrication scope to ensure deliverables were completed safely, on time and to quality standards. 
                <br><br>
                Developed the workmanship process for the fabrication contractor and subcontractors producing installation 
                standards that contractors used in the daily works to ensure the quality of installed items. 
                <br><br>
                Management of the Shiploose scope for modules prior to sailaway. Documentation assurance  and compilation of 
                site instructions, spare parts and CoG calculations. Supporting activities included final site walks to ensure 
                there were no equipment clashes with grillage during loadout and subsequent as required redline drawing markups. 
                Daily interaction with piping, electrical, structural engineers, engineering manager, marine department, HHI 
                engineers in the support leading up to ready for sailaway activities.
                <br><br>
                Coordination and facilitation of Human Factors Engineering (Safety in Design) reviews. Activities included weekly 
                model reviews and corresponding module site walk to systematically capture and rectify items before sail away to 
                prevent carry over work. Work flow process development for the site fabrication team to efficiently resolve HFE 
                punch list items.
                <br><br>
                Involvement in the Faultless Startup Initiative (FSI) team to ensure faultless startup of systems. Stringent checks 
                performed to ensure that flanges, sight glasses and drains were appropriately protected to prevent contamination 
                from debris, dust and potential corrosion. This philosophy was the build it clean, keep it clean process therefore 
                educing on site rework and subsequently reducing schedule impact and total installed cost.
                <br><br>
                Co-ordinated the sign off of RFC (Ready for Commissioning) dossiers, ensuring they were compiled and signed off 
                before module sailaway dates. The documentation was key to the executing a safe plant start-up and recorded the 
                completion of the works undertaken at the fabrication yard. Daily activities included liaising with both company and 
                contractors engineering and commissioning discipline leads. Scope included Fire and Gas, instrument process control 
                safety and small power and lighting sub-systems.

                Conducted the Wheatstone Expansion Line Size Study for Various Cases. Activities on the recommendation of line sizes for a 
                number of cases for the Wheatstone Expansion Project. The Prosper flow assurance tool was used to generate graphs which 
                were used for appropriate line size recommendations for each case.
                <br><br>
                Completed Well Kill Erosion Study for the Wheatstone Drilling Team which provided guidance and recommendations on which 
                combinations of geometry and well kill mud to use. In an event of a well blowout, one method to kill the well is to pump 
                high density kill mud into a relief well. The objective of the exercise was an assessment of the erosion rate for various 
                combinations of pipe diameters, geometry, kill mud density and flow rates and determine if wall thickness losses for a 
                typical well kill operation are tolerable. Development of a final report, which provided guidance and recommendations.
